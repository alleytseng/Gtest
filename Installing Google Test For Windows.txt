Introduction
GoogleTest is a framework based on the xUnit architecture. This framework is to write test for C++ code and valid for the most common platforms. Installation

Details
To build and install Google test library, first, we must install python and cMake in our development environment.

CMake
To obtain CMake follow this link to go to the CMake webpage. Once you reach de webpage, click on the link titled "cmake-2.8.5-win32-x86.exe", which is the CMake binary installer for Windows. This will start the downloading of the CMake installer. When prompted, select the appropriate option to store the executable file in your computer. Then, left-click twice on the installer and install CMake at the folder "C:\sde\CMake".

Python
Now, download python from the python downloads web site. We need python 2.7 version, click "Python 2.7 Windows installer". Store the executable file in your computer. Then, left-click twice on the installer and install Python at the folder "C:\sde\Python-2.7".

GoogleTest
Finally we have to download Google test library sources. Downlaod them from the GoogleTest, clicking on "gtest-1.6.0.zip". Store the download file in your computer.

Once the sources file is on your PC, place it into the user directory under your MSYS folder and extract the archive. This will typically be "C:\sde\MinGW\msys\1.0\home\username". Open an MSYS shell console and navigate to your MSYS user directory.

For build the library type:

export PATH=$PATH:/c/sde/CMake/bin:/c/sde/Python-2.7
cd gtest-version
mkdir mybuild
cd mybuild
cmake -G"MSYS Makefiles" ..
make
Now, to install built library type:

cp -r ../include/gtest /usr/local/include
cp lib*.a /usr/local/lib

可以成功編譯產生libgmock.a libgmock_main.a libgtest.a libgtest_main.a
